# CSS Web Design Bookmarks

Here's a pile of my bookmarks I found helpful or inspiring back when I was getting into CSS for Web Design. I Hope you find them useful too! They might be less directly relevant if you end up primarily working in higher-level frameworks. However, those frameworks will often be built atop these fundamental standards. So it's still good to be aware of the basics. It will give you better intuitions on what's possible, and how to communicate with people working in different levels of the stack.

## Setting up the environment;

Before we get into the links, here's a snapshot of the development environment I'm using right now;

- Version Control: For tracking your changes and coordinating them with others. I recommend following the 'Contribution Guidelines' and making your first pull request!
  - GitHub Desktop: https://desktop.github.com/
  - Short explanation; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ReR1YJrNOM
  - Long explanation; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JJ101D3knE
  - Pull Request https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8lGpZkjnkt4

- Text Editor setup;
  - Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - Extensions;
    - **Live Preview**, Microsoft
      - makes it trivial to host static web pages for testing
    - **Markdown Preview Mermaid Support**, Matt Bierner
      - Mermaid allows you to generate SVG diagrams from simple grammars. Very useful for documentation, and also Github Markdown supports it.
      - Here's the [github documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-diagrams)
    - **GitLens**, GitKracken
      - embeds git info in your editor
    - **Figma for VS Code**, Figma
      - I'm not sure how to use this yet but might help when incorporating the Figma concepts you're making!
    - **Code Spell Checker**, Side Street Software

## Mozilla Developer Network

Mozilla's documentation is both well organized for beginners and comprehensive for experts. They are pretty much my go-to resources.
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/

They also have good guides. The HTML and CSS sections are a good place to start for designers;
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn

Here is a primer on reactive design which should help for the variety of devices we want to target;
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/CSS_layout/Responsive_Design

Also it's important to have a grasp of CSS units, especially the relative ones; 
 - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Values_and_units

## Grid and FlexBox

Once you get familiar with grid and flex you can accomplish most any layout you can dream up.

When working with grid, this cheat-sheet is your friend;

For a more exercise-oriented introduction, here is Rachel Andrews' tutorials; 
 - https://gridbyexample.com/

Flexbox has a different purpose and is used in different situations;
 - https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/

These specifications are huge and devilish in the details, but if you can become conversant in grid and flex you're halfway there.

Problems arise as applications become more complex, and you need frameworks or complex naming to get out of them. However I'm betting we can keep things pretty straight-forward for this project.

## CSS Magazines

Here are some good web design blogs that help keep you up to date. I used to make a point of checking out some every day at work to stay abreast of the trends and tech. They often feature guest writers from all over the industry so be wary of the rabbit holes you can get lost in!

 - https://css-tricks.com/
 - https://www.smashingmagazine.com/
 - https://codepen.io/spark

I still reference css-tricks' guides almost every project.

## Inspiration

Here are some gems that I think capture some of the magic of the Web. A lot of these I got from the front page of CSS-Tricks over the years;

I love Jen Simmon's work. The header of her Layout Lab is inspired by 1930's avant garde printing press graphic design. Try resizing it and look at how reactive it is;

Here's an explainer of how she made it;

Here's another one of hers, a cool way to automate Mondrian paintings in CSS;

An oldie but goldie. Shows how CSS can be totally separate from content.While not as popular a philosophy nowadays because of how modern component frameworks are scoped, I really like the (possibly utopian) idea of Markup being purely semantic and designers still being able to do absolutely anything with it;

Code pen is a neat place to try out css. Here is a typography designer with amazing demos;
 - https://codepen.io/mandymichael/pens/popular

A Pinterest-like site for designers; I mainly liked how they implemented search-by-color!
 - https://www.designspiration.com/

Lynn Fischer makes really neat reactive homepages, here's her archive to try resizing;
 - https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/

An educational science blog that has amazing examples of what's possible with interactive web. This one is about watches, but be sure to check out his archives;
 - https://ciechanow.ski/mechanical-watch/

 An excellent infographic designer with neat concepts;

If you want to get into infographics, you can't beat D3- though you are definitely getting more into the developer side of things;
