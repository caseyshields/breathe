    <li>Needs to be fast as possible; we can tweak resolution, iteration limit, escape limit, simplify coloring functions, etc</li>
    <li>Works by directly setting pixels in a P5 image. Using a shader might be faster...</li>
    <li>some coloring ideas; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plotting_algorithms_for_the_Mandelbrot_set#Escape_time_algorithm">wikipedia</a></li>
    <li>I used an alternate approach here, just applying a different modulus to each channel. Gives a similar banded appearance, but with fewer operations.</li>
    <li>we might update the coloring functions to match breath rate, making bands move and brighten with the breath...</li>
    <li>In this example, if you see red, than it means there were more iterations, and the image is more expensive!</li>
    <li>Fine details are pixelated; we might cast more rays into red areas to refine them is we have cycles to spare.</li>
    <li>Need to add camera controls and fine control point controls!</li>
    <li>Using could place targets on the control points of 'deep' images for our 'souvenir'!</li>
